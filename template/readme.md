## Directory  [`input`](input)

- [`memory_tests`](input/memory_tests): Contains text files with tests for memory page replacement algorithms.

- [`processor_tests`](input/processor_tests): Contains text files with tests for CPU scheduling algorithms.

## Directory  [`output`](output)
The output directory contains both text files with reports and images showing visual results for better analysis.

- [`memory_tests`](output/memory_tests): Contains results for tests related to memory page replacement.

Example: `FIFO_basicTest.png`, `LFU_interleavedMoreOften.txt`.

- [`processor_tests`](output/processor_tests): Contains results for tests related to CPU time scheduling.

Example: `FCFS_basicTest.png`, `SJF_longShort.txt`.
